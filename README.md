# Browser Audio Player

This is a simple audio player that can be used to play audio files in the browser. It is built using [JS MediaTags](https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags) and [Color Thief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief).

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in your browser and click the file button at the top of the page to select your audio files. Once you have selected your files, they will be played in the order that they were selected.

## Features

Common audio player features, such as play, pause, and skip, are available. The player also displays information from the file's metadata and album art, and it colorizes the page based on the album art.
